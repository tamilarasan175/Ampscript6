A clothing retailer wants to send a promotional email to their customers featuring a special discount. The discount varies based on the customer's purchase history. Customers who have spent more than $100 in the past year receive a 20% discount, while those who have spent less than $100 receive a 10% discount. 

The email should dynamically display the appropriate discount code and a personalized message based on the customer's spending.
